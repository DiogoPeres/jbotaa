# JBotEvolver: Defense Patrol #

Defense patrol is an extension of the JBotEvolver project (https://code.google.com/p/jbotevolver/). The main focus of this extension is to evolve robots using Co-Evolution so that they efficient patrol a particular area and at the same create robots capable of "spying" unknown areas.

This project **is being developed** during Masters of Computer Engineering for Machine Learning course at ISCTE-IUL (http://iscte-iul.pt/home.aspx). **Check the project evolution in our Wiki page "ProjectEvolution".**

## About JBotEvolver ##
"JBotEvolver is a Java-based open-source and versatile simulation platform for education and research-driven experiments in evolutionary robotics (ER). JBotEvolver has been used in previous ER studies of our research group, from offline evolution to online evolution and learning, and from single to multi- robot systems, and in a number of undergraduate and graduate courses at ISCTE-IUL (http://iscte-iul.pt)."
